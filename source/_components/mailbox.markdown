Mailboxes provide an list of messages with short information about each.  Mailbox messages appear on a separate panel in the frontend.

Home Assistant currently supports only the [Asterisk Vaoicemail](/component/mailbox.asterisk_mbox) mailbox.

Each mailbox also automatically includes a [Mailbox Sensors](/components/sensor.mailbox) to indicate the number of messages available.
